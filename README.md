# Minigames gamemode for Garry's Mod
Originally created by Niandralades, I and two friends of mine highly edited it for our server. 
When the server opened, the project didn't last for a very long time for many different reasons.
I decided to push everything here (with the agreement of the original creator). 
Many addons are missing to respect intellectual property and copyright things. 
Take everything you want, but it might not work very well. 
Everything has been abandoned a year and a half ago, I do not support this anymore.

## Minigames available:
The following minigames are available in the folder `gamemodes/minigames` (lua files are shared between the server and the client)
   - `sh_assaultcourse`
   - `sh_capturetheflag`
   - `sh_freeforall`
   - `sh_teamdeathmatch`
   - `sh_teamsurvival`
   - `sh_twoversusall`
   
The following minigames are available in the folder `addons/minigamesdlc1` (lua files are separated between the client and the server)
   - `freezetag`
   - `gungame`
   - `oneinthechamber`
   
## Notes
- Every addons in the repo can be removed (but I suggest you to keep minigamesdlc1 to keep additional content).
- Knowledge in GLua is advised, you will certainly have script errors due to missing files.
- I'm aware that the code can be easily optimized / refactored, it has been written a year and a half ago.
